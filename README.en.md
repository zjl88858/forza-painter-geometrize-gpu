# forza-painter geometrize GPU Version

**Forza is a trademark of Microsoft. This project is unofficial and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Microsoft.**

This is a third-party geometrize JSON generation tool for [forza-painter](https://github.com/forza-painter/forza-painter). Its goal is to improve JSON generation efficiency so that higher-quality liveries can be produced in the same amount of time.

## Differences from the original project

- Uses [OpenCL-SDK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-SDK)/Vulkan to run error evaluation and primitive rasterization on the GPU for substantial speedups.
- Keeps only Rotated Ellipse rendering (other primitives are not needed for forza-painter).
- Supports PNG alpha input and protects transparent source pixels from being covered by generated geometry.
- Supports parallel batch candidate evaluation for additional performance gains.
- After each accepted primitive, it no longer recalculates full-image error; it computes the minimum delta only inside the ellipse and its bounding region.
- Rewritten in Go. After CGO compilation, binaries can be distributed directly across platforms.

## Build and install

### Requirements

```text
Go w/ CGO >= v1.24
OpenCL-SDK >= v3.0.19
Vulkan SDK >= 1.4.350.0
```

OpenCL-SDK is only needed at build time for linking. Vulkan SDK is used to compile the Vulkan backend and package `vulkan-1.dll`; end users do not need to install the Vulkan SDK to run the release package.

### Build on Windows

Clone this project, download the Windows release of [OpenCL-SDK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-SDK/releases/tag/v2025.07.23), and place it in the repository root as `OpenCL-SDK`.
Install the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) as well. The build script defaults to `C:\VulkanSDK\1.4.350.0`, or you can point `VULKAN_SDK` to another installed version.

Running `build.ps1` compiles the `.comp` shader sources, builds the single binary, and packages the release under `dist`:

- `dist\forza-painter-geometrize-go.exe`
- `dist\vulkan-1.dll`
- `dist\shaders\*.spv`

Build a single binary and generate the release package:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "build.ps1"
```

To customize the output file name:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "build.ps1" -OutputName "forza-painter-geometrize-go.exe"
```

The resulting binary includes both OpenCL and Vulkan support, and you can switch at runtime with `-backend opencl` or `-backend vulkan`. The release package already ships `vulkan-1.dll` and the SPIR-V shader files, so the target machine usually does not need a separate Vulkan SDK installation.

For Linux/macOS, use `build.ps1` as a reference and adjust `CGO_CFLAGS` and `CGO_LDFLAGS` accordingly.

## Usage

### Command line arguments

```text
Usage of forza-painter-geometrize-go.exe:
  -backend string
        GPU backend: opencl (default) or vulkan (default "opencl")
  -output string
        Output path prefix (default: input image path)
  -preview string
        Optional preview PNG output path
  -profile string
        Profile name fragment under ./settings
  -resume string
        Resume from a saved geometry checkpoint JSON
  -seed int
        Optional RNG seed for reproducible output
  -settings string
        Path to settings ini file
```

### Example

Suppose the image you want to import into Forza is `C:\work\forza\test.png`,
the preview output path is `C:\work\forza\preview`,
and the config file is `C:\work\forza\settings\c.ini`.

Run:

```cmd
forza-painter-geometrize-go.exe C:\work\forza\test.png -preview "C:\work\forza\preview" -settings "C:\work\forza\settings\c.ini"
```

The tool will print generation progress in real time, and export JSON checkpoints at the shape counts listed in `saveAt` (JSON output path can be changed with `-output`).

After JSON generation is complete and the preview looks good, use your existing forza-painter branch to import it into the game.

## Performance tests

I tested on my work tablet. Even with only an iGPU, performance is still far better than CPU mode (using forza-painter-fh6).

Also, [DavidHuang](https://github.com/hjc4869) helped test on his Ryzen AIMAX395 device. The speedup was dramatic, showing that Xe iGPU performance is not yet this program's bottleneck.

## Generative AI disclosure

During development I used generative AI to help plan tasks and write code. The non-Chinese version of this document was also translated by generative AI. The following models were used during development:

- OpenAI GPT-5.5
- OpenAI GPT-5.3 Codex
- Moonshot K2.6
